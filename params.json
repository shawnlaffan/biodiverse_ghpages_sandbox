Linked visualisation of data distributions in geographic, taxonomic, phylogenetic and matrix spaces;\r\n  1. Spatial moving window analyses including richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity and beta diversity;\r\n  1. Spatially constrained agglomerative cluster analyses; \r\n  1. Spatially constrained region grower analyses; \r\n  1. Interactive visualisation of turnover patterns (for example beta-diversity); and \r\n  1. Randomisations for hypothesis testing. \r\n\r\nBiodiverse is open-source and supports user developed extensions. It can be used both through a graphical user interface (GUI) and through user written scripts.\r\n\r\nMore than 300 indices are supported.  See the [Indices](https://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/Indices) page.\r\n\r\n*Screen shots* can be found on the ScreenShots page.\r\n\r\n**Example applications** can be seen at the [publications page](https://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/PublicationsList).\r\n\r\n*Help* can be located via the [help pages](https://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/Home) (these are also accessible via the wiki link on the right of this page).\r\n\r\nA **discussion group** is at http://groups.google.com.au/group/biodiverse-users and a **blog** at http://biodiverse-analysis-software.blogspot.com.au/\r\n\r\n\r\nTo cite Biodiverse or acknowledge its use, use the following details, substituting the version of the application that you used for \"Version 1.0\".\r\n\r\n* Laffan, S.W., Lubarsky, E. & Rosauer, D.F.
